Footnotes:
1,"Cross-sectional analysis: Graduates of each cohort are observed five years after graduation (for example, graduates of calendar year 2010 are observed in 2015). The criteria used to define the graduate subpopulations shown under Characteristics after graduation are only applied in the year of the earnings measurement. See the technical reference guide <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/37-20-0001/372000012024001-eng.htm" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Labour market outcomes for college and university graduates, 2010 to 2020 (opens new window)</a> for further information."
2,"The data are subject to annual revision. The year chosen for constant dollars may also be updated."
3,"Refers to the age of graduates on December 31st of the year of graduation. The study population only includes graduates between 15 and 64 years old."
4,"Status of student in Canada is defined on December 31st of the year of graduation. "Canadian students" include Canadian citizens and permanent residents. "International students" include students studying in Canada on student visas, non-Canadian students in Canada on other types of visas, non-Canadians whose status is unknown, and non-Canadian students studying from outside Canada (for example, by Internet). Students with missing status of student in Canada information are excluded from this analysis."
5,"Quebec CEGEP graduates with a diploma in the technical stream leading to labour market entry are included in the study population, while pre-university diploma graduates from CEGEPs are excluded. University micro-programs and attestations are excluded at the undergraduate, master's and doctoral levels."
6,""Graduates reporting employment income" excludes graduates with no income information and those who were full-time students in the year in which earnings were measured. Graduates reporting $0 in wages, salaries and commissions and in net self-employment income are included in the "Number of graduates" but not in the "Median employment income" estimates. Employment income includes wages, salaries and commissions (wages and salaries, commissions from employment, training allowances, tips and gratuities, tax exempted Indian employment income) and net self-employment income (net income from business, profession, farming, fishing and commissions). Net self-employment income may be positive, negative or zero."
7,"Graduates reporting $0 in wages, salaries and commissions and in net self-employment income are included in the calculation of the "Number of graduates"; however, they are excluded from the "Median employment income" calculation. The suppression of the median employment income is based on counts that exclude graduates reporting $0 in wages, salaries and commissions and in net self-employment income. Median employment income is suppressed to protect confidentiality when the count of graduates used to produce that estimate is small."
8,"The "Number of graduates" represents the number of individuals. Due to different study population definitions and methodology, graduate counts in this table differ from the published annual counts from the Postsecondary Student Information System (PSIS). All counts are randomly rounded. Due to rounding, components may not add to the totals."
9,"The "Median employment income" is not provided for the aggregate "Total, educational qualification".  All dollar figures are rounded to the nearest hundred. Note that income after graduation does not control for the effect of additional education that may have been obtained since the graduation year."
10,"Educational qualification is derived by combining two Postsecondary Student Information System (PSIS) variables: program type and credential type. For consistency and homogeneity across provinces and territories, two adjustments are made. (1) Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary medicine, Optometry, Pharmacy and Law degrees reported as "Undergraduate degrees" or "Post-baccalaureate non-graduate degrees" are regrouped as "Professional degrees." (2) "Post-baccalaureate non-graduate degrees" in the fields of Education and Social work are regrouped with "Undergraduate degrees". <a href="http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=1252576" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Classification of programs and credentials - professional degree variant (opens new window)<a/>."
12,"Includes "Undergraduate degree" and "Post-baccalaureate non-graduate degree" programs in the following fields of study (based on CIP Canada 2016, 6-digit classes): 22.0101 Law (LLB, JD, BCL); 51.1201 Medicine (MD); 51.0401 Dentistry (DDS, DMD); 51.2401 Veterinary medicine (DVM); 51.1701 Optometry (OD); 51.2001 Pharmacy (PharmD, BS, BSc, BPharm)."
11,"This variable uses the <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=1261820" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cannabis primary groupings (opens new window)</a> variant of the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Canada 2016 with detail on the underlying two-digit series and the sub-series coming from CIP series "30. Multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary studies". The "Personal improvement and leisure" primary grouping and non-postsecondary fields of study under the "Other" primary grouping are excluded from this table."
