"2023-01-13","On January 13, 2023, Postsecondary Student Information System (PSIS) enrolment and graduate counts have been corrected for the reference year 2008/2009 due to an error that occurred during data processing that impacted Ontario universities enrolments and graduates. This error impacts total enrolment and graduate counts for Ontario and Canada as well as university enrolment and graduate counts for Ontario and Canada."
"2019-02-12","Postsecondary Student Information System (PSIS) enrolment and graduate counts have been corrected for the reference years 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 due to an error that occurred during data processing that impacted one Ontario college. This error impacts total enrolment and graduate counts for Ontario and Canada as well as college enrolment and graduate counts for Ontario and Canada."



Footnotes:
1,"All counts are randomly rounded to a multiple of 3 using the following procedure: counts which are already a multiple of 3 are not adjusted; counts one greater than a multiple of 3 are adjusted to the next lowest multiple of 3 with a probability of two-thirds and to the next highest multiple of 3 with a probability of one-third. The probabilities are reversed for counts that are one less than a multiple of 3."
2,"The data are subject to revision."
3,"As of 2009, the college graduate counts are released for the calendar year to align with how the university graduates are reported. For 2008 and prior years, college graduates were released based on an academic year. Because of the transition of how graduates are calculated from 2008 to 2009, some graduates released in 2009 may have also been released with the 2008 college graduate data."
4,"Up to 2008, the count excludes students enrolled in programs related to pre-employment, apprenticeship, basic training or skills upgrading, second language training, job readiness or orientation programs. However, as of 2009, the count includes these programs but still excludes apprenticeship programs."
5,"Totals may not add up to the sum of all categories due to rounding."
6,"The qualifications awarded for the Quebec institutions, up to and including 2008, do not include micro programs and attestations. However, as of 2009, these are included."
7,"As per the Statistics Canada Standard approved in October 2021, the Postsecondary Student Information System (PSIS) collects information on gender. However, due to low counts, the "Non-binary person" category has been rolled into "Gender unknown" for the purposes of dissemination. <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=1326727" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">"Gender unknown" (opens new window)</a>."
8,"The “Field of study” variable for enrolments and graduates refers to the <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=1261820" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cannabis primary groupings (opens new window)</a> variant of the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Canada 2016."
9,"This category includes pre-technology education/pre-industrial arts programs; multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary studies, other; and high school/secondary diploma and certificate programs."
10,"This category includes all programs without sufficient information to be classified within the Cannabis primary groupings variant of the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)."
